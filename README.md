## Getting Started

1. Click the 'Use this template' button above the file list to create a new repository. If you want to use github.io domain, have to name the repository `{YOUR_ID}.github.io`.

2. Clone this repository, and install node modules.

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_ID}/{REPOSITORY_NAME}.git
    $ cd {REPOSITORY_NAME}
    $ npm install
    ```

3. Modify `config.json` file in `services` directory to set your blog title and subtitle.

    ```json
    {
      "blogTitle": "Lorem Ipsum",
      "blogSubtitle": "lorem ipsum"
    }
    ```

4. Publish the example articles and works by `npm run publish`. It converts a markdown documents in `_articles` or `_works` directory to HTML files.

    ```bash
    $ npm run publish article
    $ npm run publish work
    ```

5. Start local server at `http://localhost:1234/`. `npm start` script opens local server based on `server` directory. 

    ```bash
    $ npm start
    ```

6. Run deploy script if you're ready to host a live server. This script builds local files to `dist` directory and creates `gh-pages` branch that contains only the files in `dist` directory. GitHub will host live server at `https://{YOUR_ID}.github.io/` based on `gh-pages` automatically.

    ```bash
    $ npm run deploy
    ```

## Document Publishing Process

1. Write a document in `_articles` or `_works` directory.

1. Run `npm run publish article` or `npm run publish work` script to convert markdown to HTML.

1. Preview converted document on the local server using `npm start` script.

1. Run `npm run deploy` to publish the document to live server.
